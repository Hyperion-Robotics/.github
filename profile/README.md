# Hyperion Robotics 

Hyperion Robotics is a volunteering and interdisciplinary student team of the University of Western Macedonia. It was founded by undergraduate students in 2014 and currently consists of 8 members and a mentor. Our team designs and develops autonomous robots that can achieve different tasks. We mainly participate in international competitions, with our goal for next year being the Eurobot 2026. Besides our competitive side, we also contribute to special research projects.
